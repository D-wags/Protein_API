** NODE notes **

Node is asynchronous middleware to handle events - uses one thread that is nonblocking

Node is kinda like a fake browser

window is generally the global object but with node the global object is:
global.console, require, exports, __dirname, __filename, module, process, etc…

process object can be used to get env info and interact with processes. The process variable logs all running processes as an array.

HTTP module for doing server shit…
